## About Clickbait

Test project for laravel+react job position. Clickbait is a project where users can vote for a better color and find out the best one for their own projects. There is 4000 random generated colors with 4000 random comments. Users can edit color description. As well as create new and delete old comments for colors. All colors page is using custom build pagination. Its my first time with laravel+react, so a few places are not using best possible practice.
